## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/researchmm/STTR.git
```
2. Change directory to the project folder:
3. Install the required dependencies:
 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Additional Notes

* The Transfer Style Model is based on the algorithm described in the research article (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05176.pdf), also, on the code presented in the article. You can refer to the article for a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts.
* The provided code implements the algorithm and allows you to experiment with different content and style images to create various stylized outputs.

Happy stylizing!
